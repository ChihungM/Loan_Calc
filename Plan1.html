    <h2><p style="text-align:center;">About Plan 1</p></h2>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align:left;">

    You fall under this category if you took out your loan: <br><br>
    whilst in Scotland or Northern Ireland (including Postgraduate loans)<br>
    or received EU funding <b>at any time</b> in Scotland or Northern Ireland<br><br>
    or before 1st September 2012 and: <br><br>
    you have lived in England or Wales in that time <br>
    or you received EU funding in England or Wales.<br><br>

    <b>How your repayments are calculated</b> <br><br>

    Payments will be taken from your salary during any pay period if they exceed or meet 
    the threshold before tax. Your pay period will typically be every:<br><br>
    - week <br>
    - two weeks <br>
    - four weeks <br>
    - calendar month <br><br>

    The earnings threshold is: <br><br>
    - £364 a week <br>
    - £1,577 a month <br>
    - £18,935 a year <br><br>

    Any amount you earn over the threshold, 9% will be deducted from that difference. <br><br>

    For example, you earn £2,000 every month before tax so the difference will be £2000 - £1577 = £423 <br>
    9% of £423 is £38.07 so your student loan repayment is £38.07 every month. <br><br>
